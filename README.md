# Playwright_With_Javascript
Welcome to the Playwright with JavaScript Readme! This file will provide you with an overview of how to get started with Playwright using JavaScript.

## What is Playwright?
Playwright is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API for automating web browsers. It supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, and allows you to write automated tests and scripts that interact with web applications just as a user would.

## Getting Started
To get started with Playwright, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't already have it, you can download it from the official Node.js website.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can create a new project and install Playwright by running the following commands in your terminal:

This will create a new project directory, initialize a new package.json file, and install Playwright as a dependency.

## Writing Your First Test
To write your first test with Playwright, create a new file in your project directory called test.js and add the following code:

This test will launch a new Chromium browser, navigate to the example.com website, and log the page title to the console. To run this test, run any of the following commands in your terminal:

You should see the page title printed to the console.

## Writing More Complex Tests
Playwright allows you to write more complex tests that interact with web pages just as a user would. For example, you can fill out forms, click buttons, and navigate between pages.

Here is an example of a more complex test that logs in to a website and verifies that the user is successfully logged in:

This test navigates to a login page, fills out the username and password fields, clicks the login button, waits for the page to navigate, and then verifies that the user is logged in by checking for the presence of a user menu element.

## Conclusion
Playwright is a powerful tool for automating web browsers with JavaScript. With its high-level API and support for multiple browser engines, you can write complex tests and scripts that interact with web applications just as a user would. We hope this readme has provided you with a good starting point for using Playwright with JavaScript.
